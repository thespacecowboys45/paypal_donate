# Donate to the cause using Paypal

Safe, easy, effective.  Helps me cover webhosting costs at $5.95 / month at least.

# First Donation Button

I learned how to do this - click the image below, it will take you to paypal.  You can even "view source" on this page to **know** that it's going to Paypal.  Neat!

## A second button

Same as the first, just with a different image cover.  Links to the same donate - to - me page.
